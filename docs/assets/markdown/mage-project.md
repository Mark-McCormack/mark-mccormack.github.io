### Objectives

- To research and distill contemporary research on Generative AI.
- To design infographics explaining foundational concepts of Generative AI.
- To develop a tool for non-CS individuals to understand modern Generative AI.

### Overview

This project aims to provide a resource to Maynooth University students and staff from any discipline to understand Generative AI technologies. This tool will be generated by several 3rd-year students writing research artciles understandable to the layperson with infographics, all of which distilling complex AI topics into easy to understand language such that academics can make informed use of these tools. Students on this project will be asked to read several articles concerning the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (specifically Generative AI), creating notes and infographics of key concepts for the layperson and present them on a simple web interface hosted in Maynooth.

#### Step 1: Research

Students will be prompted to research several key areas of Generative AI (Mixture of Experts, Reasoning, Transformers etc.). These topics are open to suggestion and change by supervisors of this project. Each student will be given a set of papers which they will be asked to read, annotate and distill.

Upon reading the article, students will then be asked to write a professional article (reministent of Substack) on their topics. Furthermore, students will be asked to develop several infographics to explain at a glance the concepts they covered. These articles should be both informative and easily parcible for general audiences. Such articles may also include discussion on popular concepts or misconceptions about AI in the media, using the research in justifying the truth ("Do All AI Hallucinate?", "Yes/No and here's why...").

#### Step 2: Web Interface

_Caption 2: MKDocs - Turns Markdown Documents (such as students articles) into a website!_

To keep the focus of the project on the distillation and disemination of knowledge, students will write their artciles as Markdown (.md) documents. These can be easily rendered by tools such as MkDocs as a website which can be hosted on the Maynooth servers. This keeps the focus of students on the conceptual understanding and distillation of key ideas in Generative AI.

#### Step 3 (Optional): Analysis

The following tasks can be considered additional components to the projects. Such tasks may be engaged with by students only upon delivery of the above components.

- **Article Refining:** Conduct a survey with undergraduates in Maynooth regarding the articles, asking them to note where they found ambiguities, confusion or simply got bored in the article. This information can be used to refine the original versions of the articles.
- **Research Analysis:** Students may develop simple examples to prove or engage with concepts learnt in each article. For example, someone investigating the transformer architecture may develop such a model from scratch after learning it.

**Upon confirmation of the goals and tasks to be covered in this project with each supervisor, Mark P. McCormack (mark.mccormack@mu.ie) offers to outline the tasks on a GitHub repo including a Kanban board, allowing the students to upload their work and supervisors to track their progress**
